### Q2: One of the NPM packages is not working (compiling Sass, live-reload, etc). How to fix it?
**A:** Have you extensively tried fixing the problem on your own? If you failed at fixing it, please **post a detailled description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help as fast as possible! Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.
